## Project Goal
This was a school assignment. I had to make a page with 4 subpages.

Making this I discovered my love for the web. I was starting out and just kept finding new cool ways to do things.
I checked out other people's website, and saw they had animations and cool background images. So I immediatly dove into css animations, transitions and keyframes. Which barely just came out.

It's a responsive website where I manually added all the browser prefixes.

It's using floats for layouts!

## Tech

- HTML
- CSS Animations, transitions, keyframes
